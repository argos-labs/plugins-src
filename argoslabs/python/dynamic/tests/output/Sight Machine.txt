challenge
toros
tarim
is
the
leading
manufacturer
of
fertilizer
for
turkey
and
neighboring
regions.
this
large
scale
process
requires
a
huge
industrial
chemical
complex
with
each
step
in
the
production
pathway
(sulfur
acid
to
phosphoric
acid
to
ammonium
diphospate
for
example)
being
dependent
upon
the
former.
downtimes
are
extremely
costly,
with
potential
to
impact
all
areas,
including
the
on-site
co-generated
electricity
whose
surplus
also
bolsters
the
turkish
electrical
grid.
toros
approached
sight
machine
as
part
of
their
digital
transformation
and
lean
journey
with
the
clear
expectation
to
start
at
building
a
contextualized
data
platform
of
all
their
data,
facilitating
an
holistic
view
of
their

network,
before
moving
to

the
next
part
of
the
journey
is
now
underway

sight

toros
partner
to
use
their

platform
to
explore
advanced
analytics
such
as

ai,
process
optimization
(including
for
sustainability
and
emissions
management),
and
maximizing
plant
reliability
/
minimizing
asset
downtime.
this
project
was
implemented
entirely
remotely
during
the
covid-19
pandemic
and
was
possible
because
of
the
unique
way

to
