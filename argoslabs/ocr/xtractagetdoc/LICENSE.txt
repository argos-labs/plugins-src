This end user license agreement (“EULA”) governs the use of any of the versions
of ARGOS LABS Enterprise Linux, certain other ARGOS LABS software applications
that include or refer to this license, and any related updates, source code,
appearance, structure and organization (the “Programs”), regardless of the
delivery mechanism.

1. License Grant. Subject to the following terms, ARGOS LABS, Inc. (“ARGOS LABS”)
grants to you a perpetual, worldwide license to the Programs (most of which
include multiple software components) pursuant to the GNU General Public
License v.2. The license agreement for each software component is located in
the software component's source code and permits you to run, copy, modify,
and redistribute the software component (subject to certain obligations in
some cases), both in source code and binary code forms, with the exception
of (a) certain binary only firmware components and (b) the images identified
in Section 2 below. The license rights for the binary only firmware components
are located with the components themselves. This EULA pertains solely to the
Programs and does not limit your rights under, or grant you rights that
supersede, the license terms of any particular component.

2. Intellectual Property Rights. The Programs and each of their components
are owned by ARGOS LABS and other licensors and are protected under copyright
law and under other laws as applicable. Title to the Programs and any
component, or to any copy, modification, or merged portion shall remain with
ARGOS LABS and other licensors, subject to the applicable license. The “ARGOS LABS”
trademark and the “Shadowman” logo are registered trademarks of ARGOS LABS in
the U.S. and other countries. This EULA does not permit you to distribute
the Programs or their components using ARGOS LABS's trademarks, regardless of
whether the copy has been modified. You may make a commercial redistribution
of the Programs only if (a) permitted under a separate written agreement with
ARGOS LABS authorizing such commercial redistribution, or (b) you remove and
replace all occurrences of ARGOS LABS trademarks. Modifications to the software
may corrupt the Programs. You should read the information found at
https://www.argos-labs.com/about/corporate/trademark/ before distributing a
copy of the Programs.

3. Limited Warranty. Except as specifically stated in this Section 3, a
separate agreement with ARGOS LABS, or a license for a particular component,
to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, the Programs and
the components are provided and licensed “as is” without warranty of any kind,
expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability,
non-infringement or fitness for a particular purpose. ARGOS LABS warrants that
the media on which the Programs and the components are provided will be free
from defects in materials and manufacture under normal use for a period of
30 days from the date of delivery to you. Neither ARGOS LABS nor its affiliates
warrants that the functions contained in the Programs will meet your
requirements or that the operation of the Programs will be entirely error free,
appear or perform precisely as described in the accompanying documentation,
or comply with regulatory requirements. This warranty extends only to the party
that purchases subscription services for the Programs from ARGOS LABS and/or its
affiliates or a ARGOS LABS authorized distributor.

4. Limitation of Remedies and Liability. To the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law, your exclusive remedy under this EULA is to return any
defective media within 30 days of delivery along with a copy of your payment
receipt and ARGOS LABS, at its option, will replace it or refund the money you
paid for the media. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law,
under no circumstances will ARGOS LABS, its affiliates, any ARGOS LABS authorized
distributor, or the licensor of any component provided to you under this EULA
be liable to you for any incidental or consequential damages, including lost
profits or lost savings arising out of the use or inability to use the Programs
or any component, even if ARGOS LABS, its affiliates, an authorized distributor
and/or licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. In no
event shall ARGOS LABS's or its affiliates’ liability, an authorized distributor’s
liability or the liability of the licensor of a component provided to you
under this EULA exceed the amount that you paid to ARGOS LABS for the media
under this EULA.

5. Export Control. As required by the laws of the United States and other
countries, you represent and warrant that you: (a) understand that the Programs
and their components may be subject to export controls under the U.S. Commerce
Department’s Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”); (b) are not located in
a prohibited destination country under the EAR or U.S. sanctions regulations
(currently Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Sudan and Syria, subject to change
as posted by the United States government); (c) will not export, re-export, or
transfer the Programs to any prohibited destination or persons or entities on
the U.S. Bureau of Industry and Security Denied Parties List or Entity List,
or the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control list of Specially Designated
Nationals and Blocked Persons, or any similar lists maintained by other
countries, without the necessary export license(s) or authorization(s); (d)
will not use or transfer the Programs for use in connection with any nuclear,
chemical or biological weapons, missile technology, or military end-uses where
prohibited by an applicable arms embargo, unless authorized by the relevant
government agency by regulation or specific license; (e) understand and agree
that if you are in the United States and export or transfers the Programs to
eligible end users, you will, to the extent required by EAR Section 740.17(e),
submit semi-annual reports to the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and
Security, which include the name and address (including country) of each
transferee; and (f) understand that countries including the United States may
restrict the import, use, or export of encryption products (which may include
the Programs and the components) and agree that you shall be solely responsible
for compliance with any such import, use, or export restrictions.

6. Third Party Programs. ARGOS LABS may distribute third party software programs
with the Programs that are not part of the Programs. These third party programs
are not required to run the Programs, are provided as a convenience to you, and
are subject to their own license terms. The license terms either accompany the
third party software programs or can be viewed at
http://www.redhat.com/licenses/thirdparty/eula.html.
If you do not agree to abide by the applicable license terms for the third
party software programs, then you may not install them. If you wish to install
the third party software programs on more than one system or transfer the third
party software programs to another party, then you must contact the licensor of
the applicable third party software programs.

7. General. If any provision of this EULA is held to be unenforceable, the
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not be affected. Any claim,
controversy or dispute arising under or relating to this EULA shall be governed
by the laws of the State of New York and of the United States, without regard
to any conflict of laws provisions. The rights and obligations of the parties
to this EULA shall not be governed by the United Nations Convention on the
International Sale of Goods.
