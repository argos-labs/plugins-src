.SYNOPSIS
List all properties and values of the Win32_BIOS class in WMI's root/cimv2 namespace

.DESCRIPTION
This PowerShell 7 script was generated using WMIGen (formerly known as WMI Code Generator), Version 10.0.15.0 and then trimmed manually.
WMIGen's PowerShell template script was updated to PowerShell 7 by Thierry MontanÃ©.
It queries WMI to list all properties and values of the Win32_BIOS class in the root/cimv2 namepace, for the local or a remote computer.

.PARAMETER Computer
The optional name of a remote computer to be queried.
If not specified, the local computer will be queried.
